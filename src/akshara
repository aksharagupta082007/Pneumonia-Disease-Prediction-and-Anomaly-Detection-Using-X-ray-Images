ðŸ§  Today's Work Summary â€“ Model Training and Dataset Balancing

Started training our deep learning model for classification.

Observed that the dataset was imbalanced, with significantly more images of one class than the other.

Noticed that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were being negatively impacted due to this imbalance.

Analyzed the performance metrics and confirmed that the model was biased towards the majority class.

Decided to address the issue by collecting data from multiple sources to create a more representative dataset.

Merged different datasets and carefully selected images to form a balanced training, validation, and test set:

Training set: 5,000 Normal, 5,500 Pneumonia

Validation set: 500 Normal, 550 Pneumonia

Verified that the new dataset has an approximately equal distribution of both classes.

Prepared the merged dataset structure for the next round of training.

ðŸ§  Today's work summary
-we tried training our model but due to internet issues and limited computational units provided by google colab it was not successful 
-now we have decided to train our model on jupiter on our system's GPU
-so today we did necessary installation
-worked on frontend a bit
